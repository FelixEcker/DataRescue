# DataRescue Utility
This is a really basic utility I wrote to recover some raw text from a dump of a broken
partition. The search is case sensitive and does not care for spaces.

**DISCLAIMER:** I published the source code for this software as a means to be able to
use parts of the source code in other projects.

## Usage
Simply execute a .jar or the source code in your IDE and follow the instructions given
by the program. When the search has ended, a list of all search strings with the index
of the **last byte** for each match will be printed to stdout.
